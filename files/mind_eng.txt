One of the greatest challenges is being yourself in a world that's trying to make you like everyone else

The less you talk ... the more they listen

Rest is an important part of productivity

Last mile is always the least crowded

Impossible is a word used by some people who fear to dream big

Being free, being truly free consists of not being bound by the opinions that others choose to display in regards to the decisions that one chooses to make on a daily weekly, or lifetime basis.

In order to be free we have to be willing to think for ourselves, learn for our selves, and to live our lives as our real true selves. Being free is when you are able to stand up and speak in public spewing your beliefs not caring what anyone else will think of them.
