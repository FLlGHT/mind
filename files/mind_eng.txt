One of the greatest challenges is being yourself in a world that's trying to make you like everyone else

The less you talk ... the more they listen

Rest is an important part of productivity

Last mile is always the least crowded

Impossible is a word used by some people who fear to dream big

Being free, being truly free consists of not being bound by the opinions that others choose to display in regards to the decisions that one chooses to make on a daily weekly, or lifetime basis.

In order to be free we have to be willing to think for ourselves, learn for our selves, and to live our lives as our real true selves. Being free is when you are able to stand up and speak in public spewing your beliefs not caring what anyone else will think of them.

Being free is when you are able to go against the grain, when you are able to make a left when everyone else is going right, and not worry about why everyone is talking about you, or looking at you in a manner that is unfavorable, and with faces that blatantly say that they don't approve of your choices.

Nothing easy is worth doing

How you gon treat this life like you get to live again?

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become

Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficultyâ€¦
